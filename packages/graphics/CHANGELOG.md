# @cutcraft/graphics

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- fa7c303: `<Graphic>` and its 34 kinds are removed (decision 0024), with the `graphic/*` actions, the `graphic-props` and
  `deprecated-graphic` lint rules and `graphicControls`. A file that still uses `<Graphic>` gets an error naming what
  replaces it. Use the components in `@cutcraft/kit`:
  
  | Was | Now |
  |---|---|
  | `kind="lower-third"`, `-card`, `-split` | `<LowerThird>` |
  | `callout`, `speech-bubble` | `<Callout>` |
  | `badge`, `pill` | `<Badge>` |
  | `counter` | `<Counter>` |
  | `progress-bar` | `<ProgressBar>` |
  | `arrow`, `curved-arrow`, `hand-arrow` | `<Arrow>` |
  | `underline`, `marker`, `circle-scribble`, `strike` | `<Highlight>` |
  | `gradient-`, `dots-`, `grid-background` | `<Background>` |
  
  The other kinds have no component: draw them as free code (`<Svg>`, `<Motion>`, a `<Layer>`).
  
  `<Sticker src>` takes an image asset; `icon:` stickers are removed, and Lucide with them (about 0.7 MB out of every
  bundle). Draw an icon as an `<Svg>`. `@cutcraft/graphics` now holds only the free-code libraries
  (`installFreeCodeLibraries`, `/three`, `/motion`), and the kit and the player no longer depend on it.
  `GRAPHIC_ANIMATIONS` is renamed `ENTRANCE_ANIMATIONS`: they are every overlay's entrances and exits.
  
  The export also waits for an overlay's image or SVG file before it captures a frame, so a still of a sticker shows
  the image rather than nothing.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#13](https://github.com/prefix-tree/cutcraft/pull/13) [`f9ecdb4`](https://github.com/prefix-tree/cutcraft/commit/f9ecdb40e0cd3897fac4ba138b86aab700b9d28f) Thanks [@bsnisar](https://github.com/bsnisar)! - The kit's `holdLayerFrame` lets an engine layer (three.js, Motion) hold a frame until it has drawn it, so an export
  never captures a frame half drawn. `loadVideo` returns the file's `source`, which the export page loads.

- [#14](https://github.com/prefix-tree/cutcraft/pull/14) [`57f969f`](https://github.com/prefix-tree/cutcraft/commit/57f969fe2a316d3c70b76738eaf1eada043b3d7a) Thanks [@bsnisar](https://github.com/bsnisar)! - `<Graphic>` and its kinds are deprecated and will be removed in a later release. The lint warns on each one with the
  new `deprecated-graphic` rule, and `Graphic`, `GRAPHIC_KINDS` and `graphicControls` are marked `@deprecated`. Draw the
  same things with `<Motion>`, `<Three>` or a `<Layer>`; the examples and the brand-spot recipe show how.

- [#7](https://github.com/prefix-tree/cutcraft/pull/7) [`0803ecf`](https://github.com/prefix-tree/cutcraft/commit/0803ecfd09d9e75c61ac504955ef7e9c7e177acd) Thanks [@bsnisar](https://github.com/bsnisar)! - `<Three>` and `<Motion>`: a Layer can hold a three.js scene (through React Three Fiber, or plain three.js in `setup`)
  or a Motion sequence, both on the video's clock, so they scrub both ways. `@cutcraft/graphics/libraries`
  (`installFreeCodeLibraries`), `@cutcraft/graphics/three` and `@cutcraft/graphics/motion` offer them to a cut file's
  free code. The export draws them as the player does. CSS animations inside a `<Layer>` are held at the layer's time:
  they count from the layer's start, pause with the video and scrub both ways.
