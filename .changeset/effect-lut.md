Grade with a LUT: `<Effect type="lut" params={{ src: "asset:look", amount }} />` reads a 3D `.cube` file, a new manifest asset kind `lut` that `cutcraft add look.cube` checks and lists. An effect param that names an asset is read by the shader as a texture (a LUT as a `sampler3D`, an image as a `sampler2D`), loaded before the frame that needs it. `parseCube` reads the format.
