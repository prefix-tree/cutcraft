`<Composition motionBlur={{ shutterAngle: 180, samples: 8 }}>` gives the export a film camera's motion blur: the export draws each frame `samples` times across the open shutter and averages them, for footage, titles, Motion, three.js and free code alike. The preview stays sharp. The player's `exactTime` option re-renders overlays for every change of time, which the export uses for the moments inside a frame.
