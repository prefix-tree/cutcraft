Fonts are declared in the file: `font({ family, src: "asset:brand" })` for a font file and `googleFont("Titan One")` for a Google Fonts family, each returning the family to pass as a `font` prop, a theme font or a CSS `fontFamily`. The player and the export load every declared face (`state.fonts`), WOFF2 included; the export downloads Google faces once into `~/.cache/cutcraft/fonts`, so later exports need no network. The `declaration` lint checks the calls, and `font-available` takes declared families as available.
